# Weather App Version 2 â›…
This one contains the same logic as 
the older version<br><br>
**Which is:**
* getting the name of the address from the user that the user wants to know the weather of
* then fetching the geolocation of that address
* then fetching the weather of the address using the geolocation of the address
* then returning the weather to the user(.json format)<br>

What's new:
- The structure is totally different (4 layers)
- Layers: (Layer 1: Weather Controller) (Layer 2: Weather Service) (Layer 3: Forecast/Geolocation Service) (Layer 4: Forecast/Geolocation Data)
- Cleaner Code 
- Better Error Handling
